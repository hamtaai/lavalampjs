# Lavalamp.js roadmap/TODO list

- Basics
  - simple ellipses: random amount in random places with random sizes
  - don't allow overlap
  - implement static movement with bouncing
  - implement borders
  - simple colors for the blobs
  - implement heat source
- Medium
  - implement blob physics (more realistic bouncing)
  - implement blob merge/breakup
  - gradient colors for the blobs
  - merge/breakdown gradient colors
- Advanced
  - 3d version with WebGL
    - see: https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Getting-started-with-WebGL-in-p5
- Maybe/Polish
  - allow dynamic settings
  - allow presets
  - Allow manipulating blobs with mouse
  - Allow turning off heat sources (making the blobs fall/flow to the "ground")
  - implement effects (e.g whirlpool)
  - add sound
